## Description

This lab was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). You you have a React App scaffolding to start with but you will need to run `npm install` to download all it's dependencies (takes some time).

Your App will have the following components structure. Create a file per component in a folder `src/Components/`

* Visualized as a component tree

![components tree](./component_tree.png)

* Visualized as a list

* Think about how this components tree matches what a user will see in the screen.
* How many children will `App` have and who are they?
